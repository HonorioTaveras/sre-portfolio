    description="Based in Boulder, Colorado 🏔️, I work at the intersection of infrastructure, automation, and reliability, helping teams deliver software with confidence and speed. My focus is on creating systems that scale effortlessly, recover gracefully, and empower engineers to move fast without breaking things.<br/><br/>A pragmatic problem-solver with a systems mindset, I bring a breadth of experience spanning cloud platforms, infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and observability. Over my career, I’ve taken projects from proof-of-concept to production-grade, bridging the gap between development and operations while championing resilient architectures and repeatable workflows.<br/><br/>I’m passionate about reducing toil, designing paved paths, and building a culture of ownership where reliability is everyone’s responsibility. Whether it’s crafting automation that frees up human focus, mentoring teammates in best practices, or refining deployment pipelines, I aim to create environments where people and systems can thrive together."

{{< about-section
    title="About me"
    content="I thrive on turning complex, moving parts into smooth-running systems that people can trust. My work blends technical problem-solving with a focus on team enablement so engineers can spend more time building and less time firefighting.<br/><br/>I’ve navigated projects across cloud platforms, infrastructure as code, observability stacks, and CI/CD pipelines. Along the way, I’ve learned that the most impactful systems don’t just run well, they empower developers to move independently, backed by clear documentation, smart automation, and a foundation that removes barriers and accelerates delivery.<br/><br/>I work by three principles:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Enablement by Design</strong> – Create systems, documentation, and automation that let developers work independently without bottlenecks.<br/>2. <strong>Resilience in Every Layer</strong> – Build infrastructure that recovers gracefully, scales effortlessly, and reduces operational firefighting.<br/>3. <strong>Clarity Over Complexity</strong> – Favor clear processes and maintainable solutions that are kind to both the operators and the codebase."
